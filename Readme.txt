Project: Sign Language Detector is created with the help of CNN. Able to detect numbers from 0 to 9 and alphabets from A to Z
Attached files:
1) Sign_Language_Recognition_System.pdf (report)
2) Research.pdf (Details about the code)
3) Sign Language Recognition System.zip (With Latex attachments)
4) Sign predictor.py & Sign Detector.py
5) best_model_dataflair3.h5 (Saved Model)
6) Test,Train and Validate in "Dataset.7z"(Datasets)

For GUI (Real time Prediction):
A file of format .h5 is being attached
i)best_model_dataflair3.h5 (Saved model)

After giving the correct path of the "best_model_dataflair3.h5" inside the "Sign Predictor.py" the results can be seen on real time GUI.

For Code:
Data set is attached below train, validate and test. 
After giving the correct paths of the directories in "Sign Detector.py" code can be executed
